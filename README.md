How to use Github?
1. Create an account on Github. 
2. Create a new <b>repository</b>, or clone an existing one onto a local machine. 
3. Make changes on your local machine and <b>commit</b> the changes to Github using Git. 
4. Other developers can view your changes and submit <b>pull</b> requests for changes. 
5. You can review requests and merge changes into the main <b>branch</b>.



<b>Branch</b>： Lists all local branches.

<b>Clone</b>：git clone is used to copy a repository. 

<b>Commit</b>：The git commit command adds the contents of the staging area to the local repository.

<b>Fetch</b>：git fetch allows users to fetch all objects from the remote repository that don’t currently reside in the local working directory.

<b>GIT</b>：Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes to files, coordinate the work of multiple developers, and ensure code integrity. 

<b>Github</b>：Github is a Git-based Web platform that provides developers with a centralized repository management service to better collaborate, share, and manage code.

<b>Merge</b>：git merge is used to merge a branch into the active one.

<b>Merge Conflict</b>：The general types of merge conflicts depend on when the issue appears.
The conflicts happen either:
Before merging, indicating there are local changes not up to date. The conflict error message appears before the merge starts to avoid issues.
During the merge, indicating an overwrite issue. The error message appears and stops the merging process to avoid overwriting changes.

<b>Push</b>：git push is used to send local commits to the master branch of the remote repository. Here’s the basic code structure:

<b>Pull</b>：git pull merges all the changes present in the remote repository to the local working directory.

<b>Remote</b>: a remote repository, a server that hosts code that can simply be thought of as a computer on your project team for remote data exchange.

<b>Repository</b>: a safe place to store data that you have committed to all versions. Where the HEAD points to the latest version put into the repository.
